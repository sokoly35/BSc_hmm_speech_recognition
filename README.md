## Overview

Speech Recognition is a machine learning problem to identify words from audio files. In our work we will take care of Isolated Word Recognition (IWR) problem. In other words, we will define word class names and by providing audio files with single word spoken we will classify which word was spoken. Our research problem is to analyze  performance of HMM models on audio files in presence of noise. We will introduce method to overall improved performance by training model on certain noise data.  <br>
Every simulation was performed in master.ipynb file and right there data workflow was introduced. Results are saved in results directory and visualized on visualization.ipynb notebook. The notebook visualization_presentation.ipynb contains charts used for the presentation of the thesis. 

## Motivation

As I'm so interested in machine learning it was necessary to write bachelor thesis on such topic. I study Applied Mathematics. I wanted to expand my knowledge in the field of audio data processing. I heard about hidden markov models and their usecases in various speech recognition problems. Therefore, I decided to connect my interest in ML with advance math model like HMM. To expand the topic in a bit more unique direction I decided with my promoter to focus more about performance of HMM models on noised data. Everything result in ceration of biased method to improve results in IWR problem.
